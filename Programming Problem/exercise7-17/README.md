Implement your solution to Exercise 7.15 using POSIX synchronization (or Java if you want). 
* In particular, represent northbound and southbound farmers as separate threads. Once a farmer is on the bridge, the associated thread will sleep for a random period of time, representing traveling across the bridge. 
* Design your program so that you can create several threads representing the northbound and southbound farmers.
